#Enhanced File Organizer and Maintenance Tool



This project is a robust File Organizer and System Maintenance Tool designed to simplify file management, clean up clutter, and improve the overall organization of your directories. Built with Python, the tool offers a user-friendly interface through Tkinter and a wide range of functionalities to manage files efficiently.





Key Features:






File Organization-


Automatically organizes files into categorized folders (e.g., Images, Documents, Videos, etc.) based on their extensions. Customizable extensions allow users to define their own categories.




Undo Functionality-

Restores files to their original locations in case the organization needs to be reverted.




Duplicate File Detection-


Scans directories to identify and list duplicate files based on their content (MD5 hash), helping users save disk space.




Temporary File Cleanup-

Automatically identifies and deletes temporary files (.tmp, .log, .bak, etc.) to declutter directories.



Empty Folder Removal-

Detects and removes empty folders within the specified directory.



Disk Space Reporting-

Generates detailed reports on the disk space usage of each folder, providing insights into storage consumption.



Scheduled Maintenance-

Automates file organization, cleanup, and reporting tasks at a specific time daily using a built-in scheduler.



Customizable File Types-

Allows users to customize the file extensions associated with each category through a graphical interface.
